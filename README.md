The program is a disassembler that takes in a binary file (or a text file) and displays a RISC-V
assembly code equivalent along with the binary code.

**HOW TO RUN:**
- use the command as follows : RISC-Vsim *inputfilename* *outputfilename* *operation*
    - where operation is either *dis* or *sim*; 
    - the inputfile must be present in the same directory as the executable RISC-Vsim.
- Dis.c is the source code and it is compiled to the executable RISC-Vsim.

  <h1>RISC-V Disassembler</h1>

### Overview

This project is a part of CMPS 6661: Advanced Computer Architecture at Tulane University. I build a disassembler that 
takes in a binary file (or a text file) as input and displays the equivalent RISC-V assembly instructions along with the binary code.

### Usage
Please, use the the steps below to run the disassembler:

1. Use the command as follows : RISC-Vsim *inputfilename* *outputfilename* *operation*
    - where operation is either *dis* or *sim*; 
    - the inputfile must be present in the same directory as the executable RISC-Vsim.
2. Dis.c is the source code and it is compiled to the executable RISC-Vsim.
